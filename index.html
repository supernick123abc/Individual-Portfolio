      <div id="biodesc"><div id="bioheader">Hello!</div>
      <p id="about">
			Hello my name is Nick Messenger. I come from a very small town called Grapeview where I learned how to be friendly to everyone, 
			since my class only consisted of about 20 or so students. Ever since 4th grade I have played many instruments including trumpet, 
			guitar and piano. Music is a big part of my life beside computers and technology. In High School I continued music through marching 
			and concert bands as well as a drum and bugle corps called Eruption.
		</p>
      <br />
     I graduated High School with an Associates Degree through Running Start and now I am in the BASIS program at Olympic College in Bremerton. 
			I have always loved working with computers since I would play PC games from my local library as a kid. When I got older I would mess with 
			the files in the game and make my own custom textures and such. Ever since then, I knew I would like working with computers in the future.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have a great amount of hands-on experience with technology and computers. I grew up with being mainly the only one using the family PC. 
			I would add software to it, play games on it, and fix it when it had issues. I also grew up with Android devices and would regularly modify 
			and customize the OS and alter the bootstrap and ROM of my phones. I regularly help family and friends with technology.
			I am most comfortable and familiar with software related things like programming. 
			I really enjoy web-development and programming even though I could be better at both. My IT goals are to become more familiar with software development 
			and web-development, find my perfect fit/what I enjoy most in the IT world, and find a job that is flexible with my life schedule.
